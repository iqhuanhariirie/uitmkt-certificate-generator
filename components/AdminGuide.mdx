# What is UITM KT E-Certificate System?

The UITM KT E-Certificate System is a web application designed to streamline the process of securely generating and managing e-certificates for Social and Activity Clubs at Universiti Teknologi MARA, Kuala Terengganu campus. This system addresses challenges such as time-consuming processes, potential for errors, and lack of centralized verification, ensuring that e-certificates are issued with high standards of integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality.

Through the use of RSA digital signature algorithm, the system provides cryptographic mechanisms to guarantee that certificates are tamper-proof and verifiable by any recipient or third party. This user guide will walk you through the process of using the UITM KT E-Certificate System and offer instructions on how to maximize its features, ensuring that your e-certificates remain secure and reliable.
## Accessing UITM KT E-Certificate System

1. On the UITM KT E-Certificate System admin page, you will be presented with a login screen.
2. Login using your Gmail account, which has been authorized by the developer.

## User Roles

UITM KT E-Certificate System supports three different user roles. The available user roles include super administrators, regular administrators and regular users. There is not much of a difference between super administrators and regular administrators, both can access all features but only super administrators can manage administrators. Only super administrators can add other super administrators and regular administrators by registering their emails.

On the other hand, regular users can only access the verification page and certificate preview page. 

The verification page allows regular users to verify the authenticity of a certificate by uploading the downloaded certificate.
The certificate preview page allows regular users to view the certificate before downloading it. This certificate preview page link will be sent through email to the participants.
